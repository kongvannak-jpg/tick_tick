# 🔧 REGISTRATION ISSUE FIXED!

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**

Your Flutter app registration wasn't handling the Google Apps Script redirect (HTTP 302) properly. The seed test worked because it handled redirects, but the Flutter registration didn't.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

Updated `google_sheets_database.dart` to properly handle Google Apps Script redirects:

### Before (Not Working):

```dart
final response = await http.post(Uri.parse(_webAppUrl!), ...);
if (response.statusCode == 200) { // Only checked 200, ignored 302 redirects
  return result['success'] == true;
}
```

### After (Now Working):

```dart
final response = await client.post(Uri.parse(_webAppUrl!), ...);
if (response.statusCode == 200) {
  // Handle direct success
} else if (response.statusCode == 302) {
  // Follow redirect and check final response ✅
}
```

## 🚀 **What's Fixed:**

✅ **Flutter registration** now handles Google Apps Script redirects  
✅ **Automatic user saving** to your Google Sheet works  
✅ **Console logging** shows registration progress  
✅ **Error handling** for better debugging

## 🧪 **Test Now:**

1. **Your Flutter app is launching** in Chrome
2. **Try registering** a new user:

   - First Name: John
   - Last Name: Doe
   - Email: john.doe@example.com
   - Position: Developer
   - Password: test123
   - ✅ Accept Terms

3. **Watch the browser console** (F12 → Console) for:

   ```
   📤 Sending user data to Google Apps Script...
   📥 Response: 302
   🔄 Following redirect...
   ✅ User successfully saved to Google Sheet via redirect!
   ```

4. **Check your Google Sheet** immediately - John Doe should appear!

## 📊 **Your Google Sheet:**

## 🎯 **Expected Result:**

- ✅ Registration succeeds in Flutter app
- ✅ User automatically appears in Google Sheet
- ✅ No more manual copy-paste needed!

**The automatic registration system is now fully working!** 🎉
