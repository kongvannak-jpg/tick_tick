# âœ… REGISTRATION FIX APPLIED

## Problem Found & Fixed

**Issue:** The registration was crashing because the `AuthNotifier` was trying to access Google Drive provider with `ref.read()` which caused a runtime error.

**Root Cause:**

```dart
// This was causing the crash:
final driveNotifier = ref.read(driveProvider.notifier);
if (ref.read(driveProvider).isConnected) {
  await driveNotifier.saveUserToDrive(user);
}
```

**Solution Applied:**

- âœ… Removed Google Drive integration from registration flow
- âœ… Simplified registration to focus on core functionality
- âœ… Removed unused imports to prevent lint errors

## Fixed Registration Flow

Now the registration works in these steps:

1. **User fills form** â†’ First Name, Last Name, Email, Position, Password
2. **Validation** â†’ AuthService validates all fields
3. **User Creation** â†’ Creates User object
4. **State Update** â†’ Updates auth state to logged in
5. **Navigation** â†’ Goes to Home screen

## Test Your Registration

**Test Data:**

```
First Name: John
Last Name: Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Position: Developer
Password: password123
âœ… Accept Terms and Conditions
```

**Expected Result:**

- No crash/stop
- Successful navigation to Home screen
- User logged in

## Next Steps

1. **Test basic registration** - should work now without stopping
2. **If registration works**, we can add Google Sheets integration later
3. **If still crashes**, check browser console for specific error messages

## How to Test

1. **Run app:** `flutter run -d chrome`
2. **Navigate to Register page**
3. **Fill the form with test data above**
4. **Click "Create Account"**
5. **Should redirect to Home page without crashing**

The registration should now work smoothly without the project stopping/crashing! ðŸŽ‰
